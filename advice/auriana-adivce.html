            <h1><span class="hello-friend">Hello My Friend,</span>
            <br>I have some advice for you.<br>
        </h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div id="advice">

            <div class="third-width">
                <h2>Learn to think
                    <br>like a developer
                </h2>

                <p>If you don't know any developers in person, listen to Podcasts. Find podcasts about developers and coding so you can listen to people who are doing it right now.</p>

                <p>Learn from the way they speak the problems that they faced, and how they overcame them. Even if you do not understand everything- you will understand the value it has- and that is priceless!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="third-width">
                <h2> Wake up 1 hour <em>Early</em>
                </h2>
                <p>It can be hard to add more to our already full and busy lives.</p>

                <p>So if your day is already packed- then add an extra hour to the beginning of your day- and code. Make a project. Just do something regularly and you will grow so much!</p>

            </div>    


            <div class="third-width">
                <h2>Make Friends
                    <br></h2>

                <p>When you need help or are stuck on a project- you should do the read/search method. This is an <em>essential</em> skill to develop. But if the answer or help you need is not out there-turn to your friends. </p>

                <p>Everyone talks about community and it's important to join one, but what if you are shy or introverted and not the type of person to speak with strangers online?.</p>
                <p>Do it anyway. If you get on the chats and slack regularly, people will begin to recognize your name.</p>
